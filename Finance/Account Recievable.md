# Accounts Receivables

Relatively liquid assets are usually converted into cash within **30 to 60 days**.  
However, account receivables that have been determined to be uncollectable are no longer assets (they are converted into expenses).  

### Methods to Record Bad Debt:
1. **Balance Sheet Approach**: Using an aging schedule to estimate uncollectable amounts.  
2. **Income Statement Approach**: Applying a percentage to sales.

## Example Scenario

**ABC Company** begins business on **Jan 1, 2001**.  
By **Jan 31**, its **accounts receivable** total **$250,000**.  
However, the company realizes that **$10,000** of these accounts will likely be uncollectable.

### **Required**
1. Pass an adjusting entry to record the bad debt expense.  
2. Prepare a partial balance sheet.  
3. Find the **Net Realizable Value (NRV)**.
