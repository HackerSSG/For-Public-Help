# Accounts Receivables

Relatively liquid assets are usually converted into cash within **30 to 60 days**.  
However, account receivables that have been determined to be uncollectable are no longer assets (they are converted into expenses).  

### Methods to Record Bad Debt:
1. **Balance Sheet Approach**: Using an aging schedule to estimate uncollectable amounts.  
2. **Income Statement Approach**: Applying a percentage to sales.
