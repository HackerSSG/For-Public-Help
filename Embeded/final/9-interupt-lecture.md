# Now in simple what is ,use?

# Topics Covered

## 1. Interrupt
- **What**: An event that pauses the current execution of the microcontroller to handle urgent tasks. Triggered by hardware or software signals.
- **Use**: Allows efficient handling of asynchronous events without constantly monitoring devices.
- **Example**: Button press, sensor output, or timer overflow.

---

## 2. Polling
- **What**: Continuously checking a device's status in a loop.
- **Use**: Simplifies program logic but ties down the CPU.
- **Comparison**: Inefficient compared to interrupts as it wastes CPU cycles when the device is idle.

---

## 3. Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
- **What**: A function executed when an interrupt is triggered.
- **Use**: Defines the task performed in response to an interrupt.
- **Key Point**: Each interrupt has an associated ISR, and its address is stored in the interrupt vector table.

---

## 4. Polling vs. Interrupt
- **Polling**:
  - Ties down the CPU.
  - Simple to implement.
  - Cannot prioritize tasks.
- **Interrupt**:
  - Efficient use of the CPU.
  - Allows task prioritization.
  - Handles events only when needed.

---

## 5. Steps in Executing an Interrupt
1. Current instruction completes execution.
2. The program counter (PC) is saved on the stack.
3. The interrupt vector table directs the CPU to the ISR.
4. The ISR executes until a `RETI` (return from interrupt) instruction.
5. The PC is restored, and the main program resumes.

---

## 6. Sources of Interrupt in AVR
- Timers (e.g., overflow, compare match).
- External interrupts (e.g., INT0, INT1, INT2).
- Serial communication (e.g., USART receive/transmit).
- SPI, ADC, and other peripherals.

---

## 7. Interrupt inside an Interrupt
- **What**: Nested interrupts occur when a new interrupt is triggered while servicing another.
- **Key Point**: Disabled by default during ISR execution to avoid conflicts, re-enabled with `RETI`.

---

## 8. Saving SREG in ISR
- **What**: The `SREG` register contains the status of the processor (flags like carry, zero, etc.).
- **Why**: Needs to be saved and restored in ISR to preserve CPU state.

---

## 9. Interrupt Unit
- **What**: Part of the microcontroller responsible for managing and prioritizing interrupts.
- **Use**: Ensures that high-priority interrupts are serviced first.

---

## 10. Edge Trigger vs. Level Trigger in External Interrupts
- **Edge Trigger**:
  - Interrupt occurs on a signal change (rising or falling edge).
  - Suitable for short-duration events.
- **Level Trigger**:
  - Interrupt occurs when the signal remains at a certain level (HIGH or LOW).
  - Suitable for long-duration events.

---

## 11. Timer Interrupt
- **What**: Triggered when a timer overflows or matches a predefined value.
- **Use**: For time-based operations like delays, toggling pins, or periodic tasks.
- **Comparison**:
  - More reliable than delays implemented with loops.
  - Offloads timing tasks to hardware.

---

## 12. Interrupt Priority
- **What**: Defines which interrupt is serviced first when multiple interrupts occur.
- **Use**: Critical in systems where certain tasks are time-sensitive.
- **Example**: External interrupts often have higher priority than peripheral interrupts.

---

## 13. Task Switching and Resource Conflict
- **Task Switching**:
  - Interrupts enable pausing the main task to handle higher-priority tasks.
  - Useful in real-time systems.
- **Resource Conflict**:
  - Occurs when ISR and main program share the same resources (e.g., registers, memory).
  - Resolved by disabling interrupts during resource access.
