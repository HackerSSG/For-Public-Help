## **Example of Bank Reconciliation**

### **Scenario:**  
You have **$10,000** as a balance in your accounting records. However, the **bank statement** shows a balance of **$9,500**.

### **Reconciliation Steps:**

1. **Compare Deposits:**  
   - You deposited **$1,000** on December 30th, but it’s not on the bank statement yet (a deposit in transit).  
   - **Adjust the bank balance:**  
     $9,500 + $1,000 = **$10,500**

2. **Compare Checks:**  
   - A check for **$500** you wrote hasn’t cleared the bank yet (outstanding check).  
   - **Adjust the bank balance:**  
     $10,500 - $500 = **$10,000**

3. **Review Bank Fees/Debit Memoranda:**  
   - The bank charged a **$50 maintenance fee** not recorded in your books.  
   - **Adjust the accounting records:**  
     $10,000 - $50 = **$9,950**

4. **Review Credit Memoranda:**  
   - The bank credited **$50 of interest**, which isn’t in your books.  
   - **Adjust the accounting records:**  
     $9,950 + $50 = **$10,000**

### **Result:**  
After reconciliation, both the **bank statement** and your **accounting records** show a balance of **$10,000**.
