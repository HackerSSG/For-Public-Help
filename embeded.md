## Introduction to Jump and Call
Jump and Call are instructions used to control the flow of execution in a program. Jump allows unconditioned transfer of control, while Call is used to invoke a function and save the return address.

## Jump
A **Jump** is an instruction that transfers control unconditionally to a specified address in the program.

## Call
A **Call** is an instruction used to invoke a function or subroutine. It saves the return address so that control can return to the point after the function finishes.

## Stack
A **Stack** is a memory structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, used to store temporary data such as return addresses, function parameters, and local variables.

## Calling a Function
**Calling a function** refers to invoking a function or subroutine in a program, which causes the program to jump to the function’s code and execute it. Upon completion, control returns to the point after the function call.

## Time Delay
A **Time Delay** is a controlled pause in the execution of a program, often achieved using loops or timers to create a specific time interval before continuing execution.

## SBI (Set Bit in I/O Register)
**SBI** (Set Bit in I/O Register) is an instruction used to set (make high) a specific bit in an I/O register.

## CBI (Clear Bit in I/O Register)
**CBI** (Clear Bit in I/O Register) is an instruction used to clear (make low) a specific bit in an I/O register.
