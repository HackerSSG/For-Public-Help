# üìå What is Software?

**Software** is a collection of data, programs, and instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. It is the non-hardware component of computers, enabling them to perform a variety of operations such as calculations, data processing, or executing commands. Software can be categorized into **system software** (such as operating systems) and **application software** (like word processors or games).

# üìå What is Software Engineering?

**Software Engineering** is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It involves applying engineering principles to software creation to ensure the software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and meets user needs. Software engineers work on every phase of software development, from requirement gathering to system maintenance and improvement.

# üìå Nine Causes of Software Errors

1. **Faulty Requirements Definition**  
   Inaccurate or unclear requirements can lead to misunderstanding and software errors.

2. **Client‚ÄìDeveloper Communication Failures**  
   Miscommunication between the client and developers leads to the wrong software being built.

3. **Deliberate Deviations from Software Requirements**  
   Deviating from agreed-upon requirements during development can cause functionality issues.

4. **Logical Design Errors**  
   Mistakes in the logic of the software design can result in broken features or malfunctions.

5. **Coding Errors**  
   Mistakes made while writing code, such as syntax errors or incorrect logic, cause software bugs.

6. **Non-compliance with Documentation and Coding Instructions**  
   Failure to follow documented standards or guidelines can introduce inconsistencies and errors in the code.

7. **Shortcomings of the Testing Process**  
   Inadequate or incomplete testing may miss critical defects or issues in the software.

8. **Procedure Errors**  
   Errors in the software development process, such as incorrect methodologies, can affect software quality.

9. **Documentation Errors**  
   Incorrect or outdated documentation can mislead developers and testers, leading to errors.

# üìå What is Software Quality?

**Software Quality** refers to the degree to which a software system, component, or process meets the specified requirements and fulfills user needs or expectations. It is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring the product functions as intended and satisfies the users.

- **Philip B. Crosby (1979)** defined software quality as the degree to which a system, component, or process meets specified requirements.
- **Joseph M. Juran (1988)** defined it as the degree to which a system, component, or process meets customer or user needs or expectations.

## üìä Software Quality Parameters

Software quality can be discussed in terms of several parameters. These parameters are often categorized into two main groups: **Technical Quality Parameters** and **User Quality Parameters**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Quality Parameters

1. **Correctness**  
   The lack of bugs and defects. Measured in terms of defect rate (bugs per line of code).

2. **Reliability**  
   The ability of the software to perform consistently without failing. Measured in terms of failure rate (# of failures per hour).

3. **Capability**  
   The ability to perform the required functions. Measured in terms of requirements coverage (% of required operations implemented).

4. **Maintainability**  
   How easily the software can be adapted to new requirements. Measured in terms of change logs and the impact of new features (# of lines of code affected).

5. **Performance**  
   The speed and efficiency of the software. Measured in terms of CPU time and memory usage.

---

### üë• User Quality Parameters

1. **Usability**  
   The ease with which users can interact with the software. Measured in terms of user satisfaction (% of users happy with the interface and ease of use).

2. **Installability**  
   The convenience and speed of installing the software. Measured in terms of user satisfaction (# of installation problems reported).

3. **Documentation**  
   The quality of documentation provided. Measured in terms of user satisfaction (% of users happy with the documentation).

4. **Availability**  
   The ability of the software to be accessed when needed. Measured in terms of user satisfaction (% of users reporting access problems).

---

By focusing on both **technical** and **user** quality parameters, software developers ensure that the product is not only functional and reliable but also user-friendly and accessible.
