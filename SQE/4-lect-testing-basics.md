# 🧪 Software Testing

Software Testing is the evaluation of software against the requirements gathered from users and system specifications. It is conducted at various levels in the software development life cycle or at the module level in program code. Software testing encompasses **Validation** and **Verification** to ensure the software works as expected.

## 🔍 What is Alpha Testing?

**Alpha Testing** is one of the most common software testing strategies, often used by product development organizations. It takes place at the **developer’s site**, and developers observe the users and note any problems.

- **When does it happen?**  
  Alpha testing occurs when the software is near completion. Minor design changes can still be made based on the findings during alpha testing.

- **Who performs it?**  
  It is typically performed by a group independent of the design team, such as in-house software testers or QA engineers.

> **Example:**  
> During alpha testing, a product development team might test a new mobile application in-house to spot any issues before the software is released to a wider audience.

## 📦 What is Beta Testing?

**Beta Testing** is also known as **field testing** and is conducted at the **customer’s site**. This stage involves sending the system/software to end users, who install it and use it under real-world conditions. It helps gather feedback from users on the product’s quality in real environments.

- **Purpose:**  
  Beta testing aims to validate the product by real users and provides insight into the software’s quality and performance under actual usage.

- **When does it happen?**  
  It follows alpha testing and is performed in the "real-world" environment.

- **Benefits:**  
  - It reduces the risks of product failure.  
  - Enhances the quality of the software through customer validation.  
  - Provides a **complete overview** of user experience with the product.

> **Example:**  
> A company might release a beta version of its mobile app to a small group of users to receive feedback on bugs, user experience, and general performance before the final release.

## 🛠️ What is Gamma Testing?

**Gamma Testing** is the final stage of the testing process conducted before a software release. It ensures the product is ready for the market release according to all specified requirements.

- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Gamma testing primarily focuses on **software security** and **functionality**.  
  - It does not involve in-house QA activities, and the software is not modified unless a **high-priority** or **severe bug** is discovered.

- **Who performs it?**  
  A **limited number of users** perform gamma testing, and **testers do not participate**.

- **Purpose:**  
  Gamma testing verifies **specific requirements** rather than testing the entire product.

> **Example:**  
> Before releasing a new version of a product, gamma testing might be done to ensure the security features are functioning as required, but no modifications are made unless a major issue is found.

- **Limitations:**  
  Due to its **limited development cycle**, gamma testing is often skipped in many software releases.

By completing **Alpha**, **Beta**, and **Gamma** testing, software developers ensure that their product is well-tested, meets user requirements, and is ready for release.
