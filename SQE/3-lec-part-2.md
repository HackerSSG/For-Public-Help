# 📄 Requirements Review

**Requirements Review** is the second phase of the SQA process. This phase ensures software requirements are **complete, correct, and testable**. Key activities include:

- Reviewing and Verifying Software Requirements  
- Ensuring Requirements are Testable and Traceable  
- Identifying and Addressing Inconsistencies or Ambiguities  

---

## ✅ Reviewing and Verifying Software Requirements

- Analyze requirements to confirm they are **complete, accurate, and aligned** with user expectations.  
- Ensure requirements documents include all **necessary features and functionalities**.  
- Requirements should be **clear, concise, and unambiguous**.

> **Example:**  
> In a payroll system, the SQA team ensures that features like **employee info management**, **time tracking**, and **tax calculations** are fully defined.  
> They check that terms like "employee status" are consistently used and clearly defined across the document.

---

## 🔍 Ensuring Requirements are Testable and Traceable

- Requirements must be **written in a way that allows validation through testing**.  
- Each requirement should have a **corresponding test case**.  
- Requirements should be traceable through the **entire SDLC** — from design to deployment.

> **Example:**  
> If the payroll system allows employees to update personal info, there should be a test case verifying that functionality.  
> The result of this test should directly trace back to the requirement.

---

## ⚠️ Identifying and Addressing Inconsistencies or Ambiguities

- Detect **conflicting, duplicate, or unclear requirements**.  
- Work with stakeholders (e.g., business analysts) to resolve these issues **before development starts**.

> **Example:**  
> A vague requirement like “the system should be user-friendly” is hard to verify.  
> The SQA team redefines it with measurable criteria like **intuitive UI**, **clear instructions**, etc.

---

## 📌 Conclusion of Requirements Review Phase

- Confirms that requirements are **complete, accurate, testable, and traceable**.  
- Ensures developers have a **clear and consistent** understanding of what's expected.  
- Sets the stage for **effective testing and validation** throughout the SDLC.
