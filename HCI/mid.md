## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

**Definition:**  
HCI is the study of how people (humans) interact with computers and technology.

**Example:**  
When you tap on a phone app or use a mouse to click on a button — that's HCI.

**Why it matters:**  
Good HCI makes software easier to use, faster, and more enjoyable.

## 📌 HCI Key Concepts (Very Simple)

---

### ✅ What is **Interaction**?
**Definition:**  
Interaction is how a **user and a computer system** communicate with each other.

**Example:**  
Clicking a button on a website or speaking to a voice assistant.

---

### 🧩 Common Terms in Interaction

- **Domain:**  
  The area of work.  
  _Example: Online shopping._

- **Goal:**  
  What the user wants.  
  _Example: Buy a t-shirt._

- **Task:**  
  The steps to reach the goal.  
  _Example: Search > Add to cart > Pay._

---

### 🧠 Donald Norman's Model (7 Stages)

1. **Establish the goal** – What do I want?  
   _Ex: I want to send an email._

2. **Formulate intention** – Plan to act.  
   _Ex: I will open Gmail._

3. **Specify actions** – Decide actions.  
   _Ex: Move mouse, click compose._

4. **Execute action** – Do the actions.  
   _Ex: Click button, type message._

5. **Perceive system state** – See system's response.  
   _Ex: Message sent confirmation._

6. **Interpret system state** – Understand what happened.  
   _Ex: Email sent successfully._

7. **Evaluate outcome** – Check if goal is achieved.  
   _Ex: Yes, goal complete._

### ⚔️ Gulf of Execution

**Definition:**  
Gap between **what the user wants** to do and **how to do it in the system**.

**Example:**  
User wants to upload a file but can't find the upload button.

---

### 🧱 Gulf of Evaluation

**Definition:**  
Gap between **what the system shows** and **how the user understands it**.

**Example:**  
System shows error “code 500” – user doesn't know what it means.

---

### 🧮 Abowd and Beale Framework

**Four parts:**

1. **User** – The person using the system.  
2. **Input** – What the user gives (keyboard, mouse, voice).  
3. **System** – The software that processes input.  
4. **Output** – What the system shows back (text, sound, visuals).

**Example:**  
User clicks "Play" → System receives input → Plays video on screen.

---

### 🪑 Ergonomics

**Definition:**  
Designing tools to fit humans — comfort, safety, and ease of use.

**Example:**  
Chair design, screen height, keyboard shape.

## 🔄 Product Development Life Cycle (Simple Steps)

---

### 1. 🧠 Brainstorm  
**Think of ideas**  
- Come up with new product or feature ideas.  
**Example:**  
"Let’s make a mobile app for food delivery."

---

### 2. 📝 Define  
**Clear plan & goal**  
- Set product goals, features, and user needs.  
**Example:**  
"Users can browse food, place orders, and track delivery."

---

### 3. 🎨 Design  
**Create how it looks & works**  
- Make wireframes, UI/UX designs, and user flow.  
**Example:**  
Design buttons, layout, colors of the app.

---

### 4. 🧪 Test  
**Check if it works well**  
- Test with real users or QA team.  
**Example:**  
Does the order button work? Is the app fast?

---

### 5. 🚀 Launch  
**Release to the world**  
- Publish the product to users.  
**Example:**  
Upload to App Store / Play Store.

---

**Why it matters:**  
Following these steps helps build a **useful, usable, and successful product**.

## ⚔️ Gulf of Execution & Gulf of Evaluation (Simple Explanation with Examples)

---

### 🕹️ Gulf of Execution

**What is it?**  
It is the gap between **what the user wants to do** and **how easily they can figure out how to do it using the system**.

**✅ Small Gulf (Easy to Use):**  
- **Example:** A light switch.  
  You can clearly see how to turn it ON or OFF.

**❌ Large Gulf (Hard to Use):**  
- **Example:** A remote with too many buttons.  
  User doesn’t know which one to press to change input.

---

### 👀 Gulf of Evaluation

**What is it?**  
It is the gap between **what the system shows** and **how easily the user can understand what is happening**.

**✅ Small Gulf (Clear Feedback):**  
- **Example:** A progress bar showing file upload (e.g., "Uploading 50%").

**❌ Large Gulf (Unclear Feedback):**  
- **Example:** Just a spinning wheel after clicking “Submit”.  
  The user doesn’t know if it’s working or stuck.

---

**In short:**  
- **Execution = Can I figure out how to do it?**  
- **Evaluation = Can I understand what happened after I did it?**

## 🎨 Gestalt Principles (Simple & Clear)

---

### 🧠 What is Perception?
- It's how we **recognize objects** using basic visual parts like lines, shapes, colors.

---

### 🌟 Main Idea of Gestalt:
> **"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."**

We don’t just see shapes and colors — we **group them into meaningful objects**.

---

### 👁️ Key Gestalt Principles:

1. **Proximity**  
   - Items close together are seen as a group.  
   **Example:** ●● ●● → Two pairs, not 4 dots.

2. **Similarity**  
   - Things that look alike (color, shape) are grouped.  
   **Example:** 🔵🔵🔴🔴 → Two groups by color.

3. **Continuity**  
   - We prefer smooth lines/paths, not sharp angles.  
   **Example:** A curved line continues smoothly.

4. **Closure**  
   - We fill in missing parts to see a whole.  
   **Example:** A circle with a gap still looks like a circle.

5. **Figure/Ground**  
   - We separate the main object (figure) from the background.  
   **Example:** White vase between two black faces.

6. **Symmetry & Order**  
   - Symmetrical and orderly shapes are seen as whole and stable.

---

**In Short:**  
Gestalt helps designers create **clear, organized, and meaningful visuals** by using how our eyes naturally group elements.
