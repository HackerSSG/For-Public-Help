### Data Mining
The process of discovering patterns, correlations, and useful information from large datasets using statistical and computational techniques.  
**Example:** Finding purchasing trends in customer transaction data; detecting fraud in financial data.

### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train models for prediction or classification.  
  **Example:** Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.  
  **Example:** Grouping customers into segments based on buying behavior.

### Cluster Analysis
An unsupervised technique that groups similar data points into clusters without prior labeling.  
**Example:** Customer segmentation in marketing; grouping genes with similar expression patterns.

### Classification
A supervised method used to predict categorical labels for input data.  
**Example:** Email spam detection; diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.

### Regression
A supervised method to predict continuous numeric values.  
**Example:** Estimating sales revenue; predicting temperature for the next day.

### Association Analysis
Discovers interesting relationships (associations) between variables in large datasets.  
**Example:** Market basket analysis (e.g., if a customer buys bread, they also buy butter); recommending products based on prior purchases.
