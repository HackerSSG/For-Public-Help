# Software Configuration Management (SCM)

## Introduction
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is an ongoing activity applied throughout the software development process. Its primary goal is to manage changes effectively and ensure that software is maintained properly. The activities in SCM are:

- **Identify change**: Track changes made to the software.
- **Control change**: Ensure that changes are made systematically.
- **Ensure proper implementation**: Make sure that the changes are correctly implemented.
- **Report change**: Inform stakeholders about changes that have been made.
- **Control of change**: The main responsibility of SCM is to manage and control changes.

## SCM vs Software Maintenance
- **Software Maintenance** is what happens after software is delivered and is being used by the customer.
- **SCM** is a continuous process starting from the beginning of a software project and continuing until the software is retired.

## What is Software Configuration?
A **Software Configuration** consists of various items like programs, documents, and data that are part of the software development process. As the project progresses, the number of configuration items (SCIs) increases.

### Configuration Items (SCI)
An SCI is anything that is managed as a single entity within SCM. These items can be:
- Documents (e.g., specifications, design documentation)
- Test cases
- Software tools
- Code (both source code and executable)
- Data (e.g., databases, dictionaries)
- Installation and maintenance documentation

## The SCM Process
SCM addresses several important questions:
- How does an organization identify and manage versions of a program?
- How does an organization control changes before and after software release?
- Who is responsible for approving and prioritizing changes?
- How do we ensure changes are implemented correctly?
- How do we communicate changes to others?

To answer these questions, SCM includes 5 key tasks:

## 5 SCM Tasks
1. **Identification**: Tracking and identifying configuration items.
2. **Change Control**: Managing and controlling changes to software.
3. **Version Control**: Keeping track of different versions of configuration items.
4. **System Build**: Building and integrating the software from different parts.
5. **Release Management**: Managing the release of software to customers.

# Capability Maturity Model (CMM)

The **CMM** is a framework used to assess the maturity of an organization's software development process. It is a 5-level scale ranging from "Initial" to "Optimizing". The levels are:

## CMM Levels

### 1. **Level 1 - Initial (Chaotic)**
- The organization has no defined processes, leading to unpredictable results.
- Success depends on individual efforts.
- The quality is low due to lack of structure.

### 2. **Level 2 - Repeatable**
- Basic project management practices are established (e.g., cost and schedule tracking).
- The organization can repeat successful processes from previous projects, but they only work for similar projects.

### 3. **Level 3 - Defined**
- The processes for management and development are defined and documented.
- There is a shared understanding across the organization, but the quality of the processes and products is not measured.

### 4. **Level 4 - Managed**
- Focus on measuring the quality of software and processes.
- Product metrics (e.g., reliability, complexity) and process metrics (e.g., defect correction time) are collected.
- Quantitative goals are set for software quality and the process is monitored.

### 5. **Level 5 - Optimizing**
- Continuous improvement is achieved by analyzing metrics and applying innovative ideas.
- The organization fine-tunes processes based on lessons learned from previous projects.
- Best practices are identified and improved upon, leading to continuous process optimization.
