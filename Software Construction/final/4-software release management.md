# Software Release Management

## Application Management - Typical Problems

- Inability to track and manage multiple projects affecting the same or multiple systems with multiple end dates and business owners.
- Lack of predictability in delivery timeframes, costs, and support requirements.
- IT: “You will get it next phase…”
- Business: “Yeah right…”
- Breakdown in business owner confidence and trust in IT’s ability to deliver.
- Risk to application uptime.

## What is Release Management?

Release Management (aka Release Train) is a methodology for planning and implementing a set of functional components and processes in a controlled manner.

### Key Features:
- **Date-driven**: Releases are planned to meet pre-specified delivery dates.
- **Reversed Planned**: Start with target implementation dates and work backward.
- **Mechanized**: Emulates a factory operation.
- **Forecasted Schedules and Functionality**: Forces planning in advance.
- **Integrated & Predictable**: Many business needs folded into one release, everyone knows the schedule.
- **Uses SDLC & PMBOK**: Incorporates standard system development and project management best practices.

## Benefits of Release Management

- **Integrated and Transparent**: Clear view of both business and IT plans.
- **Stable Production System**: Careful testing and analysis from early in development.
- **Predictability**: Clear delivery timeframes, costs, and support requirements.
- **Resource Utilization**: Corporate resources are aligned with business priorities.
- **Used by Large Organizations**: e.g., Cisco, Sun Microsystems.

## Release Planning

### Key Considerations:
- What are the systems? Is there a grouping of systems?
- How many releases?
- When to release?
- How much overlap?

---

## Rigidity vs Flexibility

- **Rigid Release Schedules**: Depend on the organization's implementation.
  - Process for introducing "Hot Fixes" between releases.
  - Constrained to Priority 1 system bugs or business-critical enhancements.
- **Flexibility**: Release dates may have a plus/minus factor to adapt to constraints.
  - Changes to release dates affect subsequent releases.
  - Change Management is essential.

---

## Multiple Systems / Multiple Business Requests

- Systems may be tightly or loosely coupled.
- Groupings of systems: e.g., Provisioning Systems vs Operations Systems.
- Business requests may affect one or more systems.
  - Shared or competing needs must be integrated.
  - Plan releases with all relevant stakeholders from both business and IT.
- **Rolling 12-Month View**: Regular meetings to review release plans.

---

## Integration Points

- Plan where integration points should occur in the RM lifecycle.
- Avoid focusing only on interrelated functionalities discovered during analysis.

---

## Make It Official

- Use **System Development Lifecycles (SDLC)** like Waterfall or Rational Unified Process (RUP).
- Apply **Project Management best practices** like PMBOK.
- Treat each release as a project.
- Formalize policies for:
  - Scope Management
  - Metrics Management
  - Quality Management
  - Change Management
  - Strategic Release Planning
  - Integrated Testing
  - Risk Management

---

## Roles in Release Management

- **Release Manager**: Manages the entire release process. Thick-skinned and accountable.
- **Business Project Manager**: Focuses on business needs, often in tension with the Release Manager.
- **Development Manager**
- **Configuration Manager**
- **Environments Manager**
- **Testing Manager**

## Information Management Tools

- **Release Management Planning and Deployment Tool (RMPD)**:
  - Tracks multiple business requests, software deliverables, and release schedules.
  - Offers an open view of planned releases and their functionality.
  - Integrates with other IT tools like Defect Tracking, Budgeting, etc.
- Available tools:
  - Rational Suite
  - MS Excel
  - MS Project
  - Homegrown tools

## Summary

IT organizations struggle with credibility due to lack of predictability in software delivery. Release Management provides a solution by offering:
- Predictability
- Stability
- Transparency

**Key Takeaways:**
- Planning is essential. A release scheduled for June might begin in January.
- Scope is secondary to schedule.
- Release Management is not a "silver bullet"—it requires understanding of business objectives and tradeoffs.
